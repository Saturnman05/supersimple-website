                <h2>What I've practiced</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey everyone! I'm Francisco Madera, an 18-year-old who's been on a sports adventure like no other.
                    From the court to the mat, I've dabbled in a variety of sports, and let me tell you, it's been one heck of a ride!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basketball, oh man, that's my first love. The feel of the ball in my hands, the rhythm of dribbling, and the
                    rush of making that perfect shot it's like poetry in motion. I've spent countless hours honing my skills on the court,
                    competing with friends and pushing myself to new heights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soccer, or as the world calls it, football, has also been a major part of my life. The thrill of sprinting down
                    the field, the strategy behind every pass, and that incredible feeling when the ball hits the back of the
                    net it's an experience like no other. Whether it's a casual game with pals or a fierce match, soccer brings out my
                    competitive spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then there's ping pong and tennis talk about precision and finesse! The satisfying sound of the ball hitting the
                    table or the court, the intense back-and-forth rallies these sports have improved my focus and reflexes in ways I never imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Martial arts, baby! Karate and taekwondo have taught me discipline and control. Breaking boards, mastering forms
                    it's a journey of self-discovery and growth. The physical and mental aspects of these arts have shaped me into a
                    more grounded individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volleyball, the sport of teamwork and coordination, has also found a spot in my heart. Spiking the ball, diving for
                    those epic saves it's an adrenaline rush every time. The camaraderie with my teammates and the shared victories make
                    it all the more special.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there you have it, folks. My sports journey has been a fusion of sweat, passion, and unforgettable moments.
                    Each sport has molded me in its own way, teaching me life skills and values that extend beyond the field.
                    Whether it's the rush of competition or the joy of camaraderie, sports have enriched my life in ways words can't
                    fully describe. Here's to more challenges, victories, and memories on and off the court!

            <div id="2">
                <h2>My favorite sport</h2>
                <p>
                    What's up, everyone? Francisco Madera in the house, and today I want to talk about my ultimate passion: basketball. Out of all the sports
                    I've tried my hand at soccer, ping pong, tennis, karate, taekwondo, volleyball basketball takes the crown as my absolute favorite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's something magical about stepping onto the court. The squeak of sneakers against the hardwood,
                    the satisfying swish of the net, the rhythm of the dribble it's a symphony of motion that speaks to my soul. I've
                    spent countless hours perfecting my jump shot, working on my crossovers, and honing my court vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the things that draws me to basketball is its versatility. It's a game of strategy and skill, where
                    teamwork and individual brilliance intertwine. From fast breaks that get your heart racing to the art of defense
                    that requires quick thinking, every aspect of basketball challenges me in the best way possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And let's not forget the camaraderie. Playing pickup games with friends or being part of a team has given me some
                    of the best memories. The shared victories, the high-fives after a killer pass, the cheers echoing through the
                    gym it's a feeling of belonging that's hard to replicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what truly seals the deal for me is the feeling of being in the zone. When the game is on, and it's just me, the
                    ball, and the hoop it's like the world fades away, and I'm in my element. The rush of sinking that three-pointer or making
                    a clutch steal is unlike anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, yeah, basketball is more than a sport to me. It's a way of life, a constant challenge, and a source of endless joy.
                    Whether I'm shooting hoops alone to clear my mind or going head-to-head with friends on the court, basketball has
                    a special place in my heart, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next. Peace out, ballers!

                <h3>What I currently practice</h3>
                <p>
                    Today I want to give you a peek into what's currently keeping me on my toes in the world of sports and fitness.
                    While I've dabbled in various sports like soccer, ping pong, tennis, karate, taekwondo, and volleyball, there are
                    two things that are currently ruling my world: basketball and hitting the gym.
                </p>

                    Basketball remains my true love. The court is like a second home to me. The dribble of the ball, the sound of
                    sneakers against the hardwood it's a rhythm that resonates with my very being. Right now, I'm all about refining my
                    skills on the court. Working on that jump shot, perfecting my layups, and enhancing my defensive maneuvers it's a
                    continuous journey of growth and improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that's not all. Hitting the gym has become a crucial part of my routine. Whether it's lifting weights to build
                    strength or hitting the cardio machines to keep my endurance up, the gym has become my sanctuary. It's not just about
                    physical gains, but also about mental discipline and pushing my limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The balance between basketball and gym sessions is my sweet spot. They complement each other basketball hones my
                    agility, coordination, and teamwork, while the gym boosts my overall fitness and helps me stay in top shape for the
                    game I love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's all about the hustle, the grind, and the satisfaction of seeing progress. Whether I'm sinking a perfect shot on
                    the court or setting a new personal record in the gym, the feeling of accomplishment is unbeatable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, there you have it. Basketball and gym sessions are my current jam, my way of staying active and focused. Life's a
                    journey, and I'm here, embracing every step of it with a basketball in one hand and a determination to push my limits in
                    the other. Keep ballin', keep liftin', and keep chasing those goals!
