            <!-- Here I write general things about me -->
            <p>
                In this <b>Webpage</b> I'm suposed to talk about me. Currently I'm a Software Engineer Student and I'm taking this course
                to learn concepts and technologys that I belief will help me in my carreer.
                If I talk about me, perhaps I should talk about how I started and what made me choose this carreer path.
                (<i>No se si se nota pero mi idioma nativo no es el ingles</i>)
            </p>
            <p>
                It all started with me learning how videogames are made. I was curious about it and that's where I found out
                about <b>programming</b>. At first I got fascinated with the programming aspect of it, so I investigated a
                <i>bit</i> more. I started learning about programming and also in college I was introduced to programming with
                <b>C#</b> and <b>python</b> so now I will be able to say that I now many programming languages and that feels very
                rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I like many more things. I love doing excercise, my favorite sport is basketball but I also love going to the
                gym, and I've practiced tennis, soccer, karate, taek-wondo, table tennis and I also enjoy playing volleyball. I love
                watching movies (I love superheroes movies); I like to watch tv shows, anime, read manga, novels and many more things.
                I hope that after visiting this small <b>Webpage</b> <i>you</i> get to know me more.
