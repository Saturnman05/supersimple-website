            I wanted to create this game because it's what initiated my journey. The idea of developing video games sparked
            this path for me. Although, at present, my interests in programming have expanded to encompass other pursuits, the
            dream of creating video games remains close to my heart. I am committed to pursuing this dream relentlessly.
